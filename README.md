Note: 
  * Lecture topics may shift slightly by date, but homeworks and exam dates will not change.
  * Exams will take place during lecture time (1:10-2:00pm) in the lecture hall plus another room to be determined. 
  * Readings are sections in Zill *First Course in Differential Equations with Modeling Applications, 10th ed.* If you use another text, find the relevant reading using the table of contents or index.
  * Homeworks are due in recitation on the dates listed below.
  * Lectures without a specified topic are buffers for the inevitable lag.
