# Exam 3: Laplace transforms

## Expectations
​
For exam 3, you should be able to solve linear constant coefficient initial value problems using Laplace transforms,
including the techniques of
  * partial fractions
  * complete the square
  * s- and t-translation rules
  * Heaviside functions 
  * Dirac delta functions
  * convolution
  * computing transforms using the definition of the Laplace transform

You are free to make, bring, and use a table of Laplace transforms for the exam. The table should be on one side
of an 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper. Keep it to just Laplace transforms, please --no worked-out problems, definitions, 
etc.  The exam will **not** utilize exotic transforms we haven't touched on in lecture or homework.

## Advice

  * arrive a few minutes early
  * bring a pencil, eraser, and a pen
  * read the instructions and follow them --worth some portion of your grade
  * read the problem statements and do what is asked
  * be careful with algebra and calculus --don't rush!
  * keep cool and collected, try not to freak out about grades
  * check your answers by substituting them into the ODE
  * know your section number
