# Exam 1 topics

For exam 1, you should be able to recognize and solve 
  * separable equations
  * 1st order linear equations
  * exact equations
  * equations requiring substitutions
    - homogeneous*
    - Bernoulli
    - Ax+By+C

You should also be able to 
  * specify the interval of a solution of a differential equation, i.e. the range of x values over which a solution y(x) is valid.
  * find singular solutions of differential equations

Advice:
  * read the instructions and follow them
  * read the problem statements and do what is asked
  * be careful with algebra and calculus
  * check your answers by substituting them into the ODE, or in the case of exact equations, differentiating f(x,y) = c.
  * know your section number
