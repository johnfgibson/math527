# Exam 1 

## Expectations

For exam 1, you should be able to recognize and solve 
  * separable equations
  * 1st order linear equations
  * exact equations
  * equations requiring substitutions
    - homogeneous*
    - Bernoulli
    - <del>Ax+By+C</del> (drop this topic due to snow day)
  
You should also be able to 
  * solve initial value problems
  * specify the interval of a solution of a differential equation, i.e. the range of x values over which a solution y(x) is valid.
  * find singular solutions of differential equations
  
  
## Advice
  * arrive a few minutes early
  * bring a pencil, eraser, and a pen
  * read the instructions and follow them --worth 5% on your grade
  * read the problem statements and do what is asked
  * be careful with algebra and calculus --don't rush!
  * keep cool and collected, try not to worry about grades
  * check your answers by substituting them into the ODE, or in the case of exact equations, differentiating f(x,y) = c.
  * know your section number
