# Schedule for Math 527, spring 2018 UNH

1. Exams will take place during lecture time (1:10-2:00pm) on the scheduled date and lecture hall plus another room to be determined.

2. Exam dates are inviolable, unless the university officially closes due to snow or other emergency. Do not expect that you can make up an exam if you miss it. Do not make travel plans that would cause you to miss a scheduled exam or miss class the Friday after a scheduled exam â€“that would be the make-up date for a canceled exam.

3. Readings are sections in Zill First Course in Differential Equations with Modeling Applications, 10th edition. If you use another text, find the relevant reading using the table of contents or index.

4. Lectures without a specified topic are buffers for the inevitable lag.

5. Homeworks are due in recitation on the dates listed below.

6. Please refer to policies for specifics on handing in homeworks, exam procedures, etc.
