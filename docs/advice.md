# Advice for Math 527

To get good grades
   * Attend all lectures and recitations.
   * Focus. Your mind is your greatest asset. Train it like an athlete trains his or her body.
   * Focus. Your phone is a terrible distraction. Put it away whenever you're in class or studying. 

   * If you don't understand something, ask a question. 
   * Come to office hours. Get some personal attention!
   * Make a habit of writing your work in a neat and organized fashion. Sloppiness generates mistakes.
   * Always write equations. 
   * Always do the same thing to both sides of the equation. 
   * Start your homework well in advance of the due date.


To learn and prepare yourself for life (much of the same!)
   * Be careful and organized.
   * Train yourself to focus, think hard, and push out distractions.
   * Learn to recognize when you're puzzled about something, and then to do something about it. Framing a question is a good start. Be specific. 
   * Take some advanced humanities classes. They'll challenge you in unexpected ways and teach you to think critically and express yourself clearly.
