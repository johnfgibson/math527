# Math 527 Suggested Textbooks

  * D. Zill First Course in Differential Equations with Modeling Applications. Brooks/Cole.
  * [Elementary Differential Equations by William Trench](http://channelflow.org/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?tok=f7b49f&media=http%3A%2F%2Framanujan.math.trinity.edu%2Fwtrench%2Ftexts%2FTRENCH_FREE_DIFFEQ_I.PDF), a free online textbook.
  * M. Braun Differential Equations and their Applications, Springer-Verlag.
  * Boyce & DiPrima Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems, Wiley
  
The bookstore is selling Zill's textbook, 10th edition. However, you are not required to buy this book. Any edition of Zill will do. In fact, any textbook on differential equations written in the last thirty years will cover the same topics (perhaps with different notation, but you should be capable of adjusting for that). I do strongly suggest that you obtain a textbook, study it, and keep it for future reference.

If you use another text, you should be able to find appropriate readings by matching the lecture topic to your text's table of contents or index, with the following hints

  * “1st order linear” might also be called “integrating factors” or “variation of parameters”
  * “judicious guessing” might also be called “method of undetermined coefficients”
