# Math 527 Differential Equations

## Content 
In Math 527 you will learn methods for solving ordinary differential equations:
first-order equations, higher-order linear equations, series solutions, Laplace transforms,
essentials of matrix algebra, systems of differential equations, and selected applications.
Math 426 is a prerequisite. For more detail about course content, refer to the [course outline and schedule](../README.md).

## Objectives
  * Learn how to classify and solve ordinary differential equations and initial value problems
  * Learn some linear algebra (vectors and matrices) and how it applies to systems of differential equations
  * Experience the power of mathematical abstraction: vector spaces, linearity, and linear transforms
  * Bolster your mathematical and communication skills.
